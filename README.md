An interactive playground showcasing React-EXE's capabilities with live code editing, multiple examples, and real-time preview.

## ✨ Features

- **🎮 Interactive Playground**: Live code editing with Monaco Editor
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **🎨 Multiple View Modes**: Code-only, split view, or preview-only

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Important:** Before installing dependencies in the examples folder, you need to build the parent `react-exe` package first.

### Option 1: Use the setup script (Recommended)

From the examples directory:

```bash
cd examples
npm run setup
```

This will:

1. Install parent package dependencies
2. Build the parent package (`dist` folder)
3. Install examples dependencies

### Option 2: Manual setup

1. First, build the parent package:

```bash
# From the root directory
npm install
npm run build
```

2. Then install examples dependencies:

```bash
cd examples
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`)

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build
- `npm run setup` - Setup script for first-time installation

### Tech Stack

- **React 18** - UI framework
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Monaco Editor** - Code editor with TypeScript support
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful icons
- **React-EXE** - The library being demonstrated

## 🔧 Configuration

The examples are configured with:

- TypeScript support in Monaco Editor
- React and Tailwind CSS intellisense
- Custom theme (dark mode for code editor)
- External library support (ECharts, Framer Motion)

## 📝 Notes

- This examples folder is excluded from the npm package bundle (see `.npmignore` in the root directory)
- Examples demonstrate various React-EXE features including external dependencies and multi-file support
- All examples include proper TypeScript types and error handling

## 📚 Product documentation (slaps.dev)

The site serves Markdown for **runmix** and **ghost-env** at:

- `https://slaps.dev/runmix/docs` and `/runmix/docs/...`
- `https://slaps.dev/ghost-env/docs` and `/ghost-env/docs/...`

Content lives in **`src/site-docs/<product>/`** and is rendered with [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/). After editing docs in the standalone package repos, sync (when those folders exist next to this repo):

```bash
npm run sync-docs
```

To register another product, add markdown under `src/site-docs/<id>/`, then extend `src/documentation/docRegistry.ts` and `App.tsx` routes already cover `/:product/docs/:slug?`.
